## General Good Bot Practices
A guide for general good practices when making Discord bots can be found on the sidebar to your left.

The most common guidelines to follow are:
* Have a unique prefix.
* Do not make your bot trigger during normal conversation.
* Avoid making your bot chain with other bots, for example automatic table flipping and un-flipping bots.

Read #rules and #info when you get on the server, judgement is handed out swiftly for rule breakers.
Questions about a specific language need to be asked in library channel for that language.
There is no such thing as a best library or language to make a Discord bot in.

## Programming languages
You should pick a language that you're experienced with, or have at least basic understanding of.
Currently, the unofficial API consists of libraries in these languages:
